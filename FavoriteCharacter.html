		<h1>Hermione Granger:</h1> 
		<h2>The Baddest of Bitches</h2>
		<p>	Hermione Granger, if you don't know, is one of the three main characters in the <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter">Harry Potter</a> series.  Basically, she's a witch who goes to Hogwarts School of Wizardry and is the only voice of reason when the trio goes on adventures children should not be going on.  But there are a lot of reasons why she kicks ass. </p>

			<p> First off, she's a nerd.  Who doesn't love a nerd?  Especially when they're a magic nerd and provide the much needed break from the overused "Accio," "Expelliarmus" and "Crucio" spells. </p>

		<div id = "HermioneIsABadass" style = "height:290px">
			<p> She's also a total badass, which is just awesome.  She's one of the best spellcasters on the team, and manages to kick death-eater ass with grace and style.  Petrificus Totalus mother fucker. </p>

			<p>And let's not forget <strong>Emma Fucking Watson</strong>.  After becoming a child star and the face of Hermione Granger, she didn't fall into a pit of drug abuse and partying like so many others do.  No, Emma Watson became a successful model, graduated from Brown college, and was recently appointed as the UN Women Goodwill Ambasador and recently gave her <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-iFl4qhBsE">first major speech</a>.  Emma Fucking Watson, man.  </p>
